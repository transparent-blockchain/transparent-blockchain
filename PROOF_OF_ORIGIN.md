# Proof of Origin
PoO is like PoS and PoW a Solution to the Problem how to verify who is allowed to create the next Block in a Blockchain.
It is using a So Called Algorythm Stack that is Time Based and allows anyone to Supply a Algorythm to Proof the Origin and 
so Get Authority over that Topic (the name of the Algorythm). Its also a very good Solution to the plagiarism Problems 
on the Internet it Self

## Example
- bitcoin-v0.0.0-pre0 - The Bitcoin algorythm is easy as it simply validates that some block is valid via bitcoin. 
So subchains can fork of and Into the Original Bitcoin Block chain like git can fork of any checksum and merge into a new checksum
- github.com-v0.0.0-pre0 - is a PoC Algo and the first that we Implamented it has the following Pros and Cons. It allows Github 
to act as a Authority for timestamped data while github's data is modify able the results in a blockchain based on this algo 
is not modify able!

## Main Concepts
Like git allows forking of from a checksum (in our case a blockchain build out of any PoO based blockchain) we allow the same so Unlimited indipendent trees can be Securly Merged Into a Single Chain again via a New Point in any Chain. That Solved the Scalability and Performance issues of any other Solution that currently Exists. This Method has near endless Power as it can easy define for example a checksum of anypoint in time for example from a Blockchain like bitcoin and Compact it into a single
checksum so the Whole Blockchain in Time can be Referenced via this Checksum and the original Blockchain can get Archived!
