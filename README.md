This Repository Lines out how it works what the Concepts are and why this exists.

## Why?
The blockchain Models of today have a speed and scalability issue that they will not solve with the oldschool blockchain thinking. While https://www.hyperledger.org comes near to what we got already we aim to have a better Concept and tool chain 

## How?!????
We have made and researched concepts to Scale Blockchains to Infinity and adopt Blockchains of diffrent types as also ingreed data from anywhere in the world into Blockchains we call it internal simply Meta Blockchain since its a own blockchain forked from any data as also LowLevel Blockchains them self. In Fact every Blockchain is a Simple Stream with some Checksums Attached to it not more not less. It gains trust via its Mirrors that can verify new and old blocks. Simpl huh? 

### Patterns
We Have Designed Patterns for creating blockchains out of Streams since ordered Streams in Current Computing Algos supply a blockchain like DataStructure already based on Binary Protocols and other Protocols we adopted this Concepts to build Blockchains and Blockchain Technology 

We Builded it mainly in the effort to Create a International Meta Blockchain of Education and Archivments that can be verifyed by multiple algorythms indipendent to decouple Data from anywhere into a Secure Transperent Blockchain layer that is easy verify and distribute able at anyscale that is also super fast.

With the raise of Blockchain no one else at point of this writing was Creating something similar while others shared already the idea to create Education based Blockchains.

Some examples:
- https://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/de/fb/cscw/projects/blockchain-for-education.html
- We have found a smart guy who posted on https://hackernoon.com/what-type-of-blockchain-would-be-better-for-educational-tasks-a203dde826c3 he came to the same conclusion as we did. 
Quote: "Decentralized education platforms have huge ambitions that center around quantities of simultaneous real-time communications between parties all over the globe. To succeed, these companies need to overcome the blockchainâ€™s scalability problem, where transactions take an agonizingly slow time to load. Some educational blockchain companies like Tutellus have turned to innovative solutions. These include Proof of Stake (instead of Proof of Work), sharding, an off-chain system, and using a Hyperledger base."

## How did we Start our Meta Blockchain?
Like any Other Block Chain it Starts with a Master Block that will certificate 2 other Blocks at Present we are using Merkel Tree Model But via Our Secret Master Block we are Able to Switch even away from that Concept we choosed Merkel Tree because its a Proven Concept in Decentraled Networking like BitTorrent or the IPFS Project and many other projects like libp2p

## Why do we share all this Valueable Technology Open Source?
To Prove that we was the first thats how even many of Our Algorythms work now Microsofts Github Project is a Verification endpoint with his git algo to Verify that Frank Lemanschik did Invent this as the first guy on earth and published it to a blockchain. The GIT Algo is also a blockhain via references not crypt hashes its authority comes from Mirrors and having the Largest Opensource shared Code Platform github envolved makes us Proud. Thanks Microsoft and the Original github founding Team and Linus Torvald for this! When this Readme gets its first commit it will be Stamped into the Logs of Microsoft. We are currently working on some ideas to even Stamp it into the Logs of Amazon as they are also a valuable source of trust but thats more a Joke and PoC Project then anything else :)

Oh and back to Topic why do we Open Source this? We belive strong into the fact that the inventing Individual is newer Replace able in any Project as he has the Soule and Spirit to Raise its child but we want to learn from any one that is smart and Invite every one to Contribute to the Effort we did.
